# Laurens-Projects
This repository contains some pictures and CAD designs of my past projects. All folders contain at least one picture of the project. I have also included the CAD and Inkscape files for most projects. Some of these projects were done as part of a school assignment, but most were done in my free time. I have tried to add most projects from my free time, although one or two may be missing. Below you can find a quick overview of all the projects and a brief description. Enjoy!

**1. School**
   1. Cleaning robot
For my high-school graduation project, me and two friends decided to build a cleaning robot for the sports hall. None of us had any experience with electronics, design, coding... We had to learn everything and do it ourselves. It took a lot of work and many errors, but we were able to deliver quite a good result. The robot never ended up cleaning the sports hall, but it did put me on the road to becoming an engineer. Sadly, most documents have been lost to the sands of time as I hadn't learned how to properly organise things yet.

  2. Ping Pong Shooter
My first proper project at university. We had to create a device that shoots ping pong balls in a couple of different directions. It had to be able to automatically collect the balls again, which we aimed to do using a net. I was responsible for the mechanical part of the project. Additionally, I was the team leader and had to oversee everything.

  3. Disk sorter
A very fun project where we had to make a device which could sort disks of differing sizes. We did not know what the exact sizes of the disk would be so some adjustability was required. We did this by simply adding a screw to adjust the height of our sorting wedges. A small competition was set up to determine which group could sort the most disks the fastest, every wrongly sorted disk resulted in penalties. We ended up winning the competition and got a power-bank!

  5. Disassembly Digital Twin
This project was my bachelor's thesis. We had to create a digital twin of a disassembly robot, it is meant to disassemble cleaning robots. Sadly, we didn't get to build it and were only allowed to design it. I decided not to include the CAD files, since they are very heavy!

**2. Free time**
   1. Royal Game of Ur:
One of, if not, the oldest known boardgames. This project combines two of my greatest passions: History and Design. Since I am also a big fan of Avatar The Last Airbender, I decided to decorate the board game with Avatar characters. Inside is a handy storage compartment.

   2. Light box:
One of the projects I am most pleased about. This project combines laser cutting with electronics. A base containing LED lights which shine on a plexiglass display, making the decorations light up. I made quite a few of these and gave them to friends and family, the one pictured was for Mother's Day.

   3. Wedding:
My brother got married recently and I created their wedding invitations as well as a whole lot of decorations. One difficulty was in engraving the cards perfectly on both sides, I did this by cutting crosses on the edges of the cutting plane of the first engraving side. After the first side is engraved, I turn the plate around and centre it based on these crosses. It took a long time and many hours in FabLab, but it was well worth it!

   4. Cat house:
I wanted to built a house for stray cats using my beloved method of laser cutting. This was quite a big project and took me a couple of tries to get right. Many prototypes were designed and two were actually build, although I only have pictures of one available. Cats really like to sleep in it, especially during the cold winter months.

   5. Catan:
This was a gift for my brother and sister-in-law when they moved in together. It is a storage box for the board game Catan. When folded open, it is possible to play Catan on top of the box. The bottom is lined with vilt. It was a big project due to there being a lot of different components involved and the many decorations I created in the style of Catan.

   6. Carcassonne:
This was a gift for my sister and her boyfriend. It is a nicely decorated storage box for the board game Carcassonne. It is shaped like a castle and has cover art all around.

   7. Portable harddrive:
I was tired of losing my harddrive in my bag so decided to make it a box. It can now be safely stored away!

   8. Football display:
My sister's boyfriend caught a signed ball during the last football match of the season. I made him a display case to commemorate this moment.

   9. Feather box:
A feather box with a 'living edge' created to store all the beautiful feathers I find in my garden.
